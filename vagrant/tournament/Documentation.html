        <h1>Swiss Tournament Project</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
        <p>by Lydia Kalinkina, IPND student, Stage 5, back-end path</p>
        <br>Project is located at: https://github.com/flowerch/charts.git;

        This is an application that was created as a Project for IPND, Stage 5.
        <br>Overview<br>
        Working on this project involved mastering the relational databases<br>
         and the PostgreSQL database in particular, and writing and running a Python module<br>
          that uses the database.<br>
           The goal set was to keep track of players and matches in a Swiss system tournament.<br>
           For educational purposes Udacity provided students with the basis, namely:<br>
            with detailed description including programming design notes,<br>
             the repo and templates for this project including tournament.sql, tournament.py, and tournament_test.py.<br>
              The template file tournament.py contains stubs of several functions.<br>
               Each function has a docstring that says what it should do.<br>
                The template file tournament.sql required to put the database schema<br>
                 in the form of SQL create table commands.<br>
                  The file tournament_test.py contains unit tests to test the functions written in tournament.py.<br>

        <p>Technical requirements concerned installing and running a set of virtual machines include as follows.</p>
        <br>1) To have PostgreSQL and Python installed.<br> 2) To have the VirtualBox installed.<br>
         3) To have Vagrant installed.<br>
          4) To have Vagrant VM for ud197<br> (git clone http://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm fullstack).
          <br>
          <p>README.md contains instructions on how to successfully run this application.<br>
             In a nutshell it comes down to the following.<br>
              Step One - Copying tournament.py, tournament.sql, and tournament_test.py into the vagrant/tournament folder.<br>
                Next - SSH into the virtual machine using Vagrant SSH.<br>
                 From the vagrant/tournament folder in the shell,<br>
                  run psql -f tournament.sql to build the tables and view.<br>
                   From the same folder, run python tournament_test.py to test the schema.</p>
tournament.py


tournament.sql
-- Clear out any previous DB.
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS tournament;

-- Create DB.
CREATE DATABASE tournament;

-- Connect to the DB before creating tables.
\c
 tournament;

-- Create table for players.
CREATE TABLE players (
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
name text NOT NULL
);

-- Create table for games.
CREATE TABLE matches(
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
winner INT REFERENCES players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
loser INT REFERENCES players(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Create view to show standings.
CREATE VIEW standings AS
SELECT players.id,
players.name,
COUNT(matches.winner = players.id) AS wins,
COUNT(matches.*) AS games
FROM players LEFT JOIN matches
ON players.id = matches.winner OR
players.id = matches.loser
GROUP BY players.id, players.name
ORDER BY wins DESC;
